# Unique database of users

API services were developed in 2014 for companies that wanted to centralize their users for all their products / applications.
As well as to persist dynamic data of them and to label them in a graph database to direct better publicities.

## About the code

This app started based with [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org/)

MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, which provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based applications.

Then it was mutating. The [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database was added.

### Initial setup

cd into the local repo directory and run:

```console
$ npm install
```

### Running the application

```console
$ grunt
```
